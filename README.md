# Mini-ETL-Project-

In this ETL Crowdfunding project, an ETL pipeline is built using Python, Pandas, and both Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
Based on these data, four CSV files, an ERD and a table schema are generated. Finally, these processed data are loaded into a Postgres database.
